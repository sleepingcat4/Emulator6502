Emulators are a fun way to interact with a particular piece of ancient hardware/software. Quite often, we find ourselves in-need of emulators, either for fun purposes/educational reasons. 

Having this in mind, I wrote a simple emulator for CPU 6502 in C++. Though the syntax is similar to `C`. 

##### Quite a reason but why?

I recently started to practise `C++` in a serious manner. After teaching myself and going over the fundamentals to intermediate, I wanted to challenge myself to test my knowledge in writing an emulator in C++.  Better than solving boring leetCode and (Algorithm syntax is still being learnt, haha!)

To challenge myself and test my understanding of C++, I wrote an emulator in `C++` (Challenging but easier than solving Algorithms). 

**Note:** I used third-party help while writing this emulator core.
